### Charity Funding Predictor Analysis
## 1. Overview:

The non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup is interested in predicting which charity fundings end up being successful. Data containing more than 34,000 organizations previously funded by Alphabet Soup and their metadata is preprocessing and fitted into a deep learning neural network.

This process utilizes two different strategies:

- a baseline, “manual” attempt in which the hyperparameters of the neural network are predefined and fitted onto the data (73% accuracy) and

- an optimized, “automatic” attempt in which the hyperparameters were systematically tested used keras tuner (79% accuracy)


        


## 3. Results:


  3.1 Data Preprocessing:
  
    * What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    
    
    * What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    
    
    * What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    
    
    
    3.2 Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
    
    * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    
    * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    
    * What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
